// ResourceManager Interface
// 1. Terms and definitions
// 		- Resource: resource is an abstraction of anything that has a limited quota of units and can be claimed in a
//					single unit or multiple units at once. At Flyte's current state, a resource means a logical
//					separation (e.g., a cluster) of an external service that allows a limited number of outstanding
//	    	      	requests to be sent to.
//	    - Token: Flyte uses a token to serve as the placeholder to represent a unit of resource. Flyte resource manager
//	             manages resources by managing the tokens of the resources.
// 2. Description
// 		ResourceManager provides a task-type-specific pooling system for Flyte Tasks. Plugin writers can optionally
//		request for resources in their tasks, in single quantity.
// 3. Usage
// 		A Flyte plugin registers the resources and the desired quota of each resource with ResourceRegistrar at the
//		setup time of Flyte Propeller. At the end of the setup time, Flyte Propeller builds a ResourceManager based on
//		these registration requests.
//
//		During runtime, the ResourceManager does two simple things: allocating tokens and releasing tokens. When a Flyte
//		task execution wants to send a request to an external service, the plugin should claim a unit of the corresponding
//		resource. Specifically, an execution needs to generate a unique token, and register the token with ResourceManager
//		by calling ResourceManager's AllocateResource() function. ResourceManager will check its current utilization and
//		the allocation policy to decide whether or not to grant the request. Only when receiving the "AllocationGranted"
//		status shall this execution move forward and send out the request. The granted token will be recorded in a token
//		pool corresponding to the resource and managed by ResourceManager. When the request is done, the plugin will ask
//		the resource manager to release the token by calling ResourceManager's ReleaseResource(), and the token will be
//		erased from the corresponding pool.
// 4. Example
//      Flyte has a built-on Qubole plugin that allows Flyte tasks to send out Hive commands to Qubole.
//		In the plugin, a single Qubole cluster is a resource, and sending out a single Hive command to a Qubole cluster consumes
//		a token of the corresponding resource. The resource allocation is achieved by the Qubole plugin calling
//			status, err := AllocateResource(ctx, <cluster name>, <token string>, <constraint spec>)
//      and the de-allocation is achieved by the plugin calling
//          status, err := AllocateResource(ctx, <cluster name>, <token string>, <constraint spec>)
//
//      For example,
//			status, err := AllocateResource(ctx, "default_cluster", "flkgiwd13-akjdoe-0", ResourceConstraintsSpec{})
//      When the corresponding Hive command finishes, the plugin needs to make the following function call to release
//      the corresponding token
//          err := ReleaseResource(ctx, "default_cluster", "flkgiwd13-akjdoe-0")
type ResourceManager interface {
	GetID() string
	// During execution time, plugins can call AllocateResource() to register a token to the token pool associated with a resource with the resource manager.
	// If granted an allocation, the token will be recorded in the corresponding token pool until the same plugin releases it.
	// When calling AllocateResource, the plugin needs to specify a ResourceConstraintsSpec which contains resource capping constraints at different levels.
	// The ResourceConstraint pointers in ResourceConstraintsSpec, however, can be set to nil to present a non-constraint at that level
	AllocateResource(ctx context.Context, namespace ResourceNamespace, allocationToken string, constraintsSpec ResourceConstraintsSpec) (AllocationStatus, error)
	// During execution time, after an outstanding request is completed, the plugin need to use ReleaseResource() to release the allocation of the corresponding token
	// from the token pool in order to gain back the quota taken by the token
	ReleaseResource(ctx context.Context, namespace ResourceNamespace, allocationToken string) error

// that it only poses a cap at the namespace level. A zero-value ResourceConstraintsSpec means there's no constraints posed at any level.
